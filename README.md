# Child_Vaccination project
This project belongs to Ninevah University as part of my graduation demands supervised by Dr Mohammed Hazim and Dr Mamoon
The used stack is :
ReactJS + MUI for the front-end
As for the backend I used ExpressJS with TypeScript, TypeORM to connect with the database
PS: I know I need to implement a "DEMO" 
I will do it soon, look forward to it! ^^
